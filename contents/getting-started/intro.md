This is a small guide to get started quickly with LTTng kernel and user
space tracing. For a more thorough understanding of LTTng and intermediate
to advanced use cases and, see [Understanding LTTng](#doc-understanding-lttng)
and [Using LTTng](#doc-using-lttng).

Before reading this guide, make sure LTTng
[is installed](#doc-installing-lttng). LTTng-tools is required. Also install
LTTng-modules for
[tracing the Linux kernel](#doc-tracing-the-linux-kernel) and LTTng-UST
for
[tracing your own user space applications](#doc-tracing-your-own-user-application).
When the traces are finally written and complete, the
[Viewing and analyzing your traces](#doc-viewing-and-analyzing-your-traces)
section of this chapter will help you analyze your tracepoint events
to investigate.
