As [previously stated](#doc-installing-lttng), LTTng is shipped as
three packages: LTTng-tools, LTTng-modules and LTTng-UST. LTTng-tools
contains everything needed to control tracing sessions, while
LTTng-modules is only needed for Linux kernel tracing and LTTng-UST is
only needed for user space tracing.

The tarballs are available in the
<a href="http://lttng.org/download#build-from-source" class="ext">Download
section</a> of the LTTng website.

Please refer to the `README.md` files provided by each package to
properly build and install them.
