Debian "wheezy" (stable) and previous versions are not supported; you
need to build and install LTTng packages
[from source](#doc-building-from-source) for those.

Starting from Debian "jessie", packages are officially available
using Apt:

<pre class="term">
sudo apt-get install lttng-tools
sudo apt-get install lttng-modules-dkms
sudo apt-get install liblttng-ust-dev
</pre>
